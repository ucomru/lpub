This is the official logo of **Libertas Publica (Lpub)**.

## Symbol Design

- The logo is based on a stylized **"Ł"** constructed from two characters: `"L"` and `"~"`.  
- The base font is [Oleo Script](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oleo+Script) 
  by [soytutype fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?query=soytutype%20fonts).  
- The tilde (`~`) intersects the vertical bar of "L", forming a symbolic "slash" 
  that implies resistance or transition.  
- The letterform was edited manually and converted to SVG for scalability and open use.

## Colors

- **Background**: `#fffdd8`  
- **Letter (Lpub)**: `#2563eb`  
- **Accent Line**: `#ff2f4f`
